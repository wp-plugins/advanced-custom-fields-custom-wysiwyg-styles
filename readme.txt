Addition for the famous Advanced Custom Fields Plugin (ACF) to give your ACF WYSIWYG fields the possibility to be differently styled.

== Description ==

When working with ACF (Advanced Custom Fields plugin) you often need the possibility to style different WYSIWYG fields in a different way. 

This plugin adds to the body-class INSIDE the iframe a css-class. With this class, you can style your tinymce-Editor individually.

Example:
You have a ACF WYSIWYG field with the ID "foo". Then the TinyMCE editor will have a css-class "acf_foo" in the body tag.

In your tinymce.css-file now you can write special styles which should only work in this single editor.

E.g.
body.acf_foo { backround: #ccc; }

Have fun!
